# Built a Rock Paper Scissors Game with JS (using prompt and alert) ✨

Hey everyone!  

I just finished building a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game using **JavaScript**, and I’d love for you to check it out! 🎮  

🔗 **Here’s the link to play the game**: [Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://sudo-bato.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-dom/)

I used `prompt()` and `alert()` for the basic functionality, keeping it super simple for now. If you want to give feedback, feel free to reach out! I'd love to improve it. 😄

### 🧑‍💻 **How it works:**
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against the computer.
- You can win, lose, or tie.
- First to **3 points** wins the game! 🎉

### ⚙️ **Game Logic:**
- The computer randomly chooses **rock, paper, or scissors**.
- You make your choice via **prompt**.
- The game will continue until **one of you reaches 3 points**.

### 🏆 **Winning Conditions:**
- If you beat the computer, your score goes up.
- If the computer beats you, its score goes up.
- The game ends when either you or the computer reaches **3 points**.
