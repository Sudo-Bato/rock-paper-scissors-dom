#Built a Rock Paper Scissors Game with JS (using prompt and alert) ✨

Hey everyone!

I just finished building a simple Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript, and I’d love for you to check it out!

I used prompt() and alert() for the basic functionality, keeping it super simple for now. If you want to give feedback, feel free to reach out! I'd love to improve it. :)
